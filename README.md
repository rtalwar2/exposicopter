# 📡 ExposiCopter: Drone-Based RF-EMF Measurement Platform

This repository contains all code, configuration files, and visualizations developed for my master's thesis on drone-based RF-EMF (radio-frequency electromagnetic field) mapping. The system integrates a quadcopter with real-time signal acquisition, flight automation, and interference mitigation strategies for robust wireless exposure measurements.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using drones (UAVs) for autonomous RF-EMF measurements in outdoor environments. This includes:

- Developing a drone platform equipped with a broadband RF sensor.
- Designing a signal-cleaning algorithm to remove onboard electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- Performing controlled and in-situ validation flights to measure and map EMF exposure.

---

## 🧰 Features

- 📡 Real-time electric field strength logging (600–6000 MHz).
- ✈️ Autonomous flight missions using ArduPilot and MAVLink.
- 🧹 Signal-cleaning pipeline to suppress EMI from telemetry.
- 📊 Jupyter notebooks for data processing, plotting, and validation.
- 🧪 Includes turntable experiments and outdoor measurements near base stations.

## ⚙️ System Setup

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Raspberry Pi 4 (on the drone)**  
   - Run `companion_computer/pymavlink_hello_world.py` for real-time data acquisition and communication with the flight controller.

2. **Laptop (Ground Station)**  
   - Run the **FastAPI backend** located in `backend/` (manual startup required).
   - Use **Mission Planner** for mission control.
   - Start **MAVProxy** in WSL to forward telemetry between components.
   - Use `automate_everything.ps1` (as administrator) to:
     1. Attach the USB device to WSL.
     2. Launch MAVProxy.
     3. Start Mission Planner.

3. **Optional: Simulated Environment**  
   If you don’t have a physical drone, use `start_sim_local.sh` to start a simulated ArduPilot drone with MAVProxy locally. This allows full system testing in a virtual environment.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run
On the Raspberry Pi, run:    
```bash
    python companion_computer/pymavlink_hello_world.py
```
On the laptop, open PowerShell as administrator and run:
```powershell
    .\automate_everything.ps1
```
to start the system, however to run a simulated veriosn of the drone use, 
```bash
    ./start_sim_local.sh [windows_local_ip]
```
to start mavproxy linked with simulated drone.

Then, start the backend manually:
```bash
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
